Folk Dancing

My priority is to create resources for students that supplement 
the class. The website you have begun should have categories:
Reed Sunday Folk Dance Classes which would include written
introduction to the class and separate descriptions of each 
dance taught + the instructional video for the dance. Eventually,
the website will supersede the video link I've been using.
History of Reed Folk Dancing as a second priority should 
include a written history with accompanying pictures, news
articles, a biographical history, a contemporary history.
A Folk Dancing Directory for other folk dance opportunities 
locally and elsewhere.

For the immediate future, I would like you to focus on the 
first category as a more useful resource for the students.
I will write a general introduction to the class and introductions
to each session, as well as, introductions to each of the dances,
all of which you can critique.
